# Portfolio
My rebuilt portfolio, with completed projects and a music hire page. The band is active, and we are for hire. This site mostly consists of basic CSS, with Materialize used for buttons, modals, and the grid.

## Navigation & Usage
Use the orange nav bar at the top for navigation. Additional links are provided in the footer for ease of access. Some projects put in portfolio with links to live sites, github, or video demos. Landing home page has a convenient resume PDF download button.
